# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Tickybot Clone

![TickyBot Page](https://dzwonsemrish7.cloudfront.net/items/0m0c071w3T3H2w0g2714/Image%202019-08-23%20at%2010.24.47%20PM.png)

## Overview
This project provides you with great practice for making a modern looking 
webpage by cloning the [TickyBot Page](https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/) 
using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript**.

When you are done, you will be ready to take on your own projects creating 
similar webpages. It is almost sure that you have seen a layout like the 
TickyBot's before. Many organizations such as restaurants, designers and even 
web developers design their own static or portfolio websites with an almost 
identical structure.

You could make different versions to use in future web apps you develop! 🚀

## Instructions

For this project you MUST use **vanilla** (plain) HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
You are encouraged to use CSS grid, flexbox, media queries, a naming system 
like BEM, semantic HTML tags, or other modern techniques. You may not use 
frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap.

> You may **NOT** use frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap.

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects can also be found in the [Chingu
Library](https://voyage.docs.chingu.io/prework/howwork).

### Cloning A Website

Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to 
the template. Fonts, colors, and images are not important. The layout of the 
web page on the other hand should be the same. A suggestion would be to 
compare the way the template looks face to face to the clone.

And no, you don't have to re-create the TickyBot animation if you don't 
feel ready :) If you want, use this opportunity to get creative and come up 
with something of your own for that space.

### Requirements

*Structure*
- [ ] Explore the [TickyBot page](https://tickybott.herokuapp.com) and identify
the components that make it up.
- Create your HTML with a container for each section. for instance:

      - [ ] Navigation bar
      - [ ] Header
      - [ ] Content sections
      - [ ] Footer
      
- [ ] Write the HTML for the rest of the page and the contents of each section.
- [ ] Create your JavaScript to implement a smooth scroll to top button (see Functionality below).

*Style*
- Create your CSS

      - [ ] Since the goal of this project is to create a clone of the TickyBot
            page you will want to make sure that your app mimics the layout, 
            fonts, color scheme, and visual elements in the original Tickybot 
            app. Because it is a clone you may not change the style, even 
            though it may run counter to your personal preferences.
      - [ ] What will you use for your layout: floats, flexbox or grid?
      - [ ] Once you decide, start by creating the structure of the webpage and 
            then add the styles (e.g. colors, fonts).
      - [ ] You should use native CSS or CSS preprocessors like SASS or Stylus. 
            You may not use a CSS library like Bootstrap. 

*Functionality*
- [ ] With JavaScript, create the smooth scrolling effect to the corresponding 
section that was clicked from the navbar. 
- [ ] Also, the "Scroll to top" button should also smooth scroll to the top
of the page when clicked.
- [ ] The 'Add to Slack' buttons on the page should redirect to the 
slack.com page.

*Other*
- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust `README.md` (see
[Keys to a Well-Written Readme](https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d))
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting
- [ ] Deploy your website

      Once you're done with the requirements and the console is free of 
      errors, deploy your application. You can use services like GitHub pages, 
      Netlify or Heroku. It's up to you! 

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Make your design fully responsive (see 
[Responsive Web Design Basics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive))
- [ ] Anticipate and handle any edge cases
- [ ] Use Accessibility techniques (see 
[The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)) to improve your site for users 
with impairments
